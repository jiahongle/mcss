### Team capacity: 27 story points

### Goal
We want to get these features working: upcoming events displayed on home page with data fetched from the back end, a working authentication for admin login, a menu to navigate the site, a footer at the bottom, a component to hold images from previous events, as well as concrete UI designs for these features on Figma

### Spikes

Spike #1 - Image uploading
We want to figure out how we will deal with image uploading and where our images will be stored so that our users can see images onto our website.

Spike #2 - Mail Chimp
We have to look into mail chimp and investigate how to integrate it into our server.

Spike #3 - Displaying Rich Text in Upcoming Events
The description of an upcoming event on the home page is strictly plain text and we needed to be able to display rich text since admins can create an event description that has bold text or even hyperlinks.
