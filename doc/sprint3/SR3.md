# What are the practices that you should continue during next sprint:

What worked well this sprint was we had regular stand up meetings every other day and everyone was on time, that way we could get frequent updates on how everyone is doing. We also had several very productive work sessions where we adopted extreme programming. It helped us focus on particularly hard problems and solve them quicker as two people are working on it together. We also maintained frequent contact with the product owners, the MCSS execs, to ensure that our features align with their expectations.

# What are some new practices that you might want to use during next sprint:

We should definitely find more time to work on user stories earlier, so we don’t have to rush at the end. This may mean that we have to reshuffle our schedules to prioritize this project over other courses during the first week of the sprint. We should also not be afraid to seek help from other group members when coming across a problem as we’re all working towards the same goal of completing this project to the standards we set. We should also prioritize polishing existing features to prepare for release. It is better to have a decent amount of working and polished features than having all features badly implemented.

# What are (if any) harmful practices you should stop using during next sprint:

We forgot to start the sprint on Jira untils days later. This didn’t really affect the burndown chart because no tasks were finished before we started the sprint. But nonetheless it is a harmful practice and we should remember to start the sprint on Jira on the first day of the sprint. Also, many commits were made very late during the sprint. This could have led to chaos as different team members could be confused about the progress of the sprint. We should instead commit and push often to back up our progress as well as to keep team members up to date, instead of having a few very large commits near the end of the sprint.

# What was your best/worst experience during sprint 2:

The best experience was seeing the project approach completion. It is satisfying to see functionality that we planned months ago coming to life. Another outstanding experience was seeing team members spend time to help each other even with everyone's busy schedules.

The worst experience was that this sprint included various heavy user stories that required lots of work. This affected the stress levels of our members, especially when trying to juggle work between different courses.
