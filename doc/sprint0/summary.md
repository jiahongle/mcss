## Project Objectives:

Our group will create the official MCSS website that will enable MCSS executives to make and edit announcements, and communicate event details. As well allow students and professors to stay up to date with any MCSS related news. 

The website must:

* Display MCSSâ€™s information and executive team.
* Have a Resources page helpful for students in the field of computer science, mathematics, and statistics.
* Enable executives to log in and publish MCSS event information.
* Have Mailchimp Integration.
* Have a section that can redirect to our Shopify website.

## Key users:
* MCSS executive team members.
* Regular users: professors and students at UTM.

## Key use cases: 
* Students looking for resources for CS/Math/Stats as well as MCSS announcements and events
* MCSS executive team members can publish and edit MCSS event information
* MCSS executive team members can use Mailchimp integration to email announcements to users in the subscription list
* MCSS executive team members can post photos of past events
* MCSS executive team members can advertise other MCS clubs in UTM by adding links to other clubs in a partners page

## Key usage scenarios:
* Deandra is a CS student and she wants to find out more information about the online MCSS gaming event that is going to be hosted sometime near the future. They will be able to check out the MCSS website to find out exactly what date and the details of that event.

* Chen Ling is an MCSS executive who wants to promote a gaming event that the MCSS will be held in the future, she will use Mailchimp on the MCSS website to send out an email to notify everyone on the subscription list about the event that is about to be held.

* Pradeep  is an MCSS executive member who wants to upload the footage that was taken at last week's event onto the MCSS website so they have some evidence that an MCSS event had happened.

* Steven is a student who wants to buy an MCSS hoodie or T-shirt, he will be redirected to the shopify MCSS website.
