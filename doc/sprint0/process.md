__How did you organize the team? Which tools did you use, if any?__

Our primary method of communication is Discord. Through Discord, we maintain constant communication throughout the week and hold our meetings. We will of course also use Jira to manage our user stories and product backlogs.

__How did you make decisions?__

We make decisions democratically. After taking time to understand a given problem, we discuss our different perspectives and try to find the solution that would best fit the requirements of our client. If after discussion our group can not yet come to a single conclusion, a vote is taken to decide on the final decision.

__How did you define priority and/or points of user stories?__

Our client has separated various features of the site into two categories. A must-haves category and a nice-to-have category. We further sort the priority of each feature by basing it off on how important each feature is to produce a product that meets all the must-have features given by our client.

__How frequently did you meet?__

We currently hold a minimum of one meeting every week. We also increase the number of meetings we hold as we see fit to deliver features on time to remain synchronized.

__What lessons should you take forward to the next phase?__

Moving forward, we will put more emphasis on dividing workloads effectively. When faced with completing multiple tasks at the same time, we often had the same group members working on the same documents while none worked on others. By having a clearer and more concrete division of work, we can guarantee that the development process will run smoother and more efficiently in the future.
