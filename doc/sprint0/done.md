__The whole team needs to agree as to what “done” means for the features you will implement.__ 
- All features must be tried, tested and fully functional to be considered “done”. 
- Code must be commented appropriately and organized neatly for other team members to read/update to ensure 
consistent quality. 
- Features must have met the acceptance criteria which is described in the User story.
