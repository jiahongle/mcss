__Existing product:__ \
https://github.com/utmmcss/mcss-website \
The mcss website is not currently hosted, but the github still exists. 

__How is your product different?__ \
Compared to the existing product, our solution will work and be hosted, \
It will have features such as mailing services and will allow executives to login and edit information on the MCSS website 

__If your product is better for specific users and/or specific scenarios, who are the users and/or what are the scenarios?__ \
Our product is tailored towards students and professors at UTM since the website will primarily be used for making \
announcements related to MCSS events/news. It will also host a variety of resources that students at UTM may find useful 

__Why do you think the competitors didn’t focus on these users and/or scenarios? And, what would it take from them to do so?__ \
Their product was unfinished so we were unable to identify what they weren’t able to focus on.
