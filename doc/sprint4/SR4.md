# What are the practices that you should continue during next sprint:

What worked well this sprint was we had regular stand up meetings every other day and everyone was on time, that way we could get frequent updates on how everyone is doing. We also had several very productive work sessions where we adopted extreme programming. It helped us focus on particularly hard problems and solve them quicker as two people are working on it together. We also maintained frequent contact with the product owners, the MCSS execs, to ensure that our features align with their expectations.
Another practice that was working extremely well was finishing user stories earlier, this allowed us to give time to polish and allow us to take our time. There was a lot of good communication during the sprint, allowing us to be on top of our user stories during the sprint allowing us to work efficiently.

# What are some new practices that you might want to use during next sprint:

Something that we can try out next sprint is to test out each other branches while doing the pull request to ensure that we catch all bugs before merging. This will help reduce bugs and future problems.

Having complicated code without comments. There are some considerable hard user stories during our sprint. This meant that team members needed to decipher other team members' code, this is not good because that meant we had to spend time to figure out what other people were writing. For future sprints we should always have comments especially for logically complex sections of code.

# What was your best/worst experience during sprint 4:

The best part of this sprint was being able to seamlessly work and not have too many merge conflicts. We are continuing to work and merge onto the main branch very often without having the main branch break. Seeing a product being built to completion and having all the code working is great.

The worst experience is the amount of work needed to be done within the sprint as well as dealing with other courses. Working on a project with 5 other people requires a lot of planning and takes time, this means that although it is rewarding, making time for team members while working on 4-5 other courses means that this sprint is a highly intense sprint.
