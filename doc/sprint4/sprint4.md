### Team capacity: 48 story points

Goal
To finish all remaining user stories. This includes back-end work such as mail chimp. On the Front-end for the features we want to be able to display MCSS events nicely. 
We want to get these features working: upcoming events displayed on home page with data fetched from the back end, a working authentication for admin login, a menu to navigate the site, a footer at the bottom, a component to hold images from previous events, as well as concrete UI designs for these features on Figma

### Spikes

Spike #1 - Mailchimp
Being able to use mailchimp's api and incorporate their api within our application
